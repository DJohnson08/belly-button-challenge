This module used the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset to find microbes found in human belly buttons. The dataset shows that only a few microbial species (OTU) were found in people, while the rest were much less common.

This data set also takes a sample from a set group of people, Im guessing if we expanded and used multiple samples from people who lived different lifestyles the dataset would look different. 

After using java in this module I feel more confident in my ability to apply this to real world data plotting.
